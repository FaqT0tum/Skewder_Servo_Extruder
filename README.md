# PAY ATTENTION

The Closed Loop firmware has not yet been completed, 
but for now it is possible to use the extruder in Open Loop mode with the ARSI firmware for klipper

Unfortunately for now the only difficulty in accessing the project is the creation of the rollers that are not available on the market, 
but you can create them if you can through the drawing that I have provided.
